                    since that was a bootstrapped startup all of their profits were going back into the startup. It was
                    back then when he realized the need for personal finance and passive income in his life. He was
                    already studying financial markets and this event sparked a reason for him actively pursue the
                    financial markets and raised different options of passive income.</p>

                        <p class="my-4"> When you think of the stock market and buying stocks in particular, think of
                            buying a fractional piece of a business. if you, for instance, buy an ice cream shop Monday,
                            you wouldn’t sell it the next day. You also wouldn’t buy into a business in which you don’t
                            understand its economics. It would be foolish to do so. when you speak of education on the
                            stock market, my response would be to educate yourself on the business you invest in. Make
                            sure you are also paying a sensible price, and that comes with understanding the time value
                            of money. you’ll find very valuable business’s advice reading Warren Buffett’s letters to

                            makes sense to pursue it as a career. When I think of poker, it is obviously not just a deck
                            of cards and chips. Success in Poker revolves around a very stringent set of skills, without
